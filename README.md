- **Public Companies Only**: Requires valid stock ticker symbols

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**Q: App shows "Demo Mode" instead of live data?**  
A: This indicates API rate limiting. Demo data provides full functionality while showcasing capabilities.

**Q: Custom ticker not working?**  
A: Ensure you're using valid stock symbols (e.g., TSLA, NVDA, IBM). Check spelling and try again.

**Q: Charts not loading?**  
A: Refresh the page and ensure stable internet connection. Fallback data will load automatically.
